\cvparagraph{Why Me?}
I have had a very broad range of engineering experiences, ranging from my aerospace education, to my years working in optics research, to my time in wind turbine blade research. Throughout all of my project and professional experience, I can say what I  enjoy most is being part of a small, closely knit team of highly motivated, diverse, and creative engineers daring to dream up new technologies. I would love to further discuss my qualifications and am available for interviewing at your convenience.
